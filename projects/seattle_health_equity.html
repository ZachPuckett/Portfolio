        <h1>GIS for Mapping Seattle</h1>
          <p>This project developed a Health Equity Index for Seattle census tracts by combining health-related indicators to reveal spatial patterns of disadvantage using ArcGIS Pro.</p>
          <p>The analysis incorporated five variables—including insurance coverage and chronic illness rates—selected from public datasets, and standardized them into z-scores to form a composite index indicating areas of poor health outcomes.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Health variables were selected based on variation, breadth, and non-redundancy using correlation plots.</li>
            <li>Each selected variable was standardized to z-scores, then averaged (with or without weighting) to create the Health Equity Index.</li>
            <li>Quintile classifications were used to identify areas of very low to very high equity needs, visualized with choropleth maps.</li>
            <li>ArcGIS Pro tools including ‘Standardize Field’ and ‘Calculate Composite Index’ were used throughout, supporting both manual and automated workflows.</li>

          <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Areas with very high health disadvantage</strong> were concentrated in South and Southeast Seattle, highlighting communities with the greatest need for health intervention.</li>
                  <li><strong>Census tracts with very low disadvantage</strong> were found primarily in North Seattle, suggesting better health outcomes and access to resources in those neighborhoods.</li>
                  <li><strong>Disparities across neighboring tracts</strong> revealed sharp contrasts in health equity, indicating uneven distribution of health burdens within short geographic distances.</li>
                  <li><strong>Access to health insurance</strong> had a strong influence on the final composite index when weighted more heavily, shifting priority areas for potential public health action.</li>
                  <li>The <strong>composite map</strong> provided a clear visual of cumulative health burdens, supporting targeted equity planning based on spatial patterns in chronic illness, disability, and care access.</li>
