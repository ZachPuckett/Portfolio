        <h1>GIS for Mapping Seattle</h1>
          <p>This project developed a Health Equity Index for Seattle census tracts by combining health-related indicators to reveal spatial patterns of disadvantage using ArcGIS Pro.</p>
          <p>The analysis incorporated five variables—including insurance coverage and chronic illness rates—selected from public datasets, and standardized them into z-scores to form a composite index indicating areas of poor health outcomes.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Health variables were selected based on variation, breadth, and non-redundancy using correlation plots.</li>
            <li>Each selected variable was standardized to z-scores, then averaged (with or without weighting) to create the Health Equity Index.</li>
            <li>Quintile classifications were used to identify areas of very low to very high equity needs, visualized with choropleth maps.</li>
            <li>ArcGIS Pro tools including ‘Standardize Field’ and ‘Calculate Composite Index’ were used throughout, supporting both manual and automated workflows.</li>

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Structure Fires</strong> were concentrated heavily in West and Southwest Kent, indicating a persistent risk zone for structural emergencies.</li>
              <li><strong>Rescue/EMS incidents</strong> were more widely distributed across the city, but still centered heavily in West and Central Kent.</li>
              <li><strong>Service Calls and “Other” incidents</strong> followed a similar distribution to EMS, showing notable clustering in Central Kent alongside the dominant West Kent region.</li>
              <li><strong>Fire, Explosion, and HazMat calls</strong> also peaked in West and Central Kent, but diminished rapidly outside those areas.</li>
              <li>The <strong>combined map</strong> of all emergency responses revealed a hotspot at the intersection of West and Central Kent, underscoring the area's elevated emergency activity overall.</li>
