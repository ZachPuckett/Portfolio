            <h1>CSE 416 Kaggle Competition: Who Can Build the Strongest Classifier?</h1>
        </header>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>This project involved developing a machine learning model to predict whether students would earn a course certificate based on their engagement data from Harvard and MIT’s 
                edX platform. Participants trained and evaluated models using a provided dataset containing student activity variables, then submitted predictions to a Kaggle-hosted leaderboard. 
                Models were built and optimized in a platform of their choice, simulating real-world model deployment scenarios.</p>

        <h3>Model Workflow</h3>
            <p>You will see two models below. The first is a basic decision tree classifier which I created to gauge the level of complexity 
                required to predict on this dataset. In an effort to improve my training accuracy, I advanced to a random forest classifier. 
                This model yielded a signficantly higher training accuracy, and was therefore chosen to be used on the test data. I optimized 
                performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV. This enabled my model to reach 97.75% prediction accuracy on the test data.</p>
        
            <p> My approach placed 6th out of 125 competitors in the class, highlighting both the model’s effectiveness and my ability to optimize machine learning workflows. 
                This project reinforced my skills in data-driven model selection, performance evaluation, and iterative 
                refinement to enhance predictive accuracy. </p>
