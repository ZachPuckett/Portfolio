        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>This project showcases the random forest classifier I built to predict whether
            students would earn a course certificate based on their activity in Harvard and MIT’s edX platform.</p>
    
        <p>You will see two models below. The first is a basic decision tree classifier which I created to gauge the level of complexity 
            required to predict on this dataset. In an effort to improve my training accuracy, I advanced to a random forest classifier. 
            This model yielded a signficantly higher training accuracy, and was therefore chosen to be used on the test data. I optimized 
            performance by fine-tuning hyperparameters with GridSearchCV. This enabled my model to reach 97.75% prediction accuracy on the test data.</p>
        
        <p> My approach placed 6th out of 125 competitors in the class, highlighting both the model’s effectiveness and my ability to optimize machine learning workflows. 
            This project reinforced my skills in data-driven model selection, performance evaluation, and iterative 
            refinement to enhance predictive accuracy. </p>
