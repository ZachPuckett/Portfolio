## Welcome to my Portfolio


This repository showcases the various projects I've undertaken during my time at the University of Washington. Here you will find my spatial analyses using ArcGIS, machine learning models built in Python, linear regression models developed in R, and a time series animation created with Google Earth Engine from satellite imagery.
